Hello Nelson,

Please predict the transactions that will occur every day in March. 

Be prepared to discuss how you arrived at this model, and anything you find interesting about the data.

A department store is interest in how much pints of ice cream they should stock over the next four months. 

Based on the Sales.csv data set, predict how many pints of ice cream the store should stock for September, October, November, and December.

The transactions data set is the number of transactions that occurred on a specific cycle date. 

Transactions cannot occur on the 5th, 11th, 14th, 17th, 24th, 27th, 29th, 30th, or 31st.  

The company is interested in predicting the number of transactions that will occur every day in March of 2015.

You may direct any questions to Andrew.Meng2@VZW.com and Kevin.Scott2@VZW.com

I would like to have our interview at 2 30 PM on Friday. 

Will this work?

Thanks,
Kevin Scott

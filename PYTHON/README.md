These are MY leetcode solutions provided solely as 
code samples for job interview qualifications. I
coded each solution that is shown and have a leetcode
submission profile to show this. None is copied from 
any site.

These are leetcode solutions (meaning the def statement
has a type-based signature), so to verify them, you
need to go to leetcode.com and run them.

I am providing them because I realized that after a 
hiatus of SEVERAL YEARS from employment I realized that
I had ZERO recent code samples to show to prospective 
employers --- I mean, samples which were meaningful, 
concise but more importantly, recent or easily 
benchmarked and replicatable.

ALL THESE SAMPLES WERE PRODUCED 
    FROM FEBRUARY 2020
    TO the present (JUNE 2020 and on)

BECAUSE OF THE INTENDED END-GOAL, ONLY 
    MEDIUM
    HARD
    problems are shown.

THESE SAMPLES do represent a A MEANINGFUL LOOK at 
the current state of my coding style, practices, 
strategies and thinking. My implementation on 
them proceeded with NO TIMEr but at a BEST RATE
I could. This means, from a FEW MINUTES to a COUPLE
OF HOURs on the some -- with some exceptions
on which I had to take a break to think abou them. 

Prior to that, from Jun/2016 through Jun/2018, I was 
away from programming -- barely breathing or surviving. 
Currently, these samples rank relatively well. However, 
I expect that as I settle more into programming again,
the competition quality of my samples will further 
increase.

THIS REPOSITORY IS INTENDED SOLELY FOR PROSPECTIVE 
EMPLOYERS for the purpose of evaluation of my application. 
To this end, employment evaluators ought to be allowed
to copy and paste my solutions into leetcode and try 
them to see them working.

Others, please refrain from copying, accessing, or 
using this code. Solely for this reason, the python 
code samples are copyrighted. Obviously, this does 
not include the leetcode problem descriptions.

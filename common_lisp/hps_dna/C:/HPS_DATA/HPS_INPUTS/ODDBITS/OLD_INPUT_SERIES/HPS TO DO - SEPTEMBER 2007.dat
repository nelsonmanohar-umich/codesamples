to do - for hps transform basic application

        autodiags is wrong value
	check various correspondance of fields into fulldata array

	gui for input time series
	gui for sliders on input parameters
	gui for input of sensor parameters
	gui for report sections choice selection interface 
	plots as gui for summary statistics using sampled segmetns and fine tracking plus summary stat-values in plot

	html report generator for report
	html report - select text for analysis html
	- html report generator for summary statistics
	- html report generator for image?
	- html generator for graphic
	- html report generator for histograms?
	- html report include files

	- bug with relative error when values in input signal are negative causes nils into the reltive error
	- bug with lambda was nth cdr being 0 instead of 4. weird mistypo.

	versioning multiple versions backup

	error message module
	win32 invocation from lisp to gnu, system cmd
	invocation from lisp for html code viewer
	code to invoke from windows other to lisp command
	code to do gui elsewhere in windows and invoke system command such as gnu
	
	- combine correspondance maps into one
	- select subset of maps

	gnuplot how to use colored lines 
	- gnuplot scripts debugging
	
	summary stats selection
        - input parameters writing into stats file
	- summary statistics
	- summary stat text file
	- summary stats generation of html surrounding it - 

	pass parameter options on controllable codes such as printable segment decision how-to for segment plots 
	pass parameter options output parameters in input to transform

	- done - hps transform output file ( 1 2d or side-by-side or ternary tuple format)
	- done - check outlier behavior - seems wrong - test with k=1
	- done - print function - reduced

	bug of pooled-var being negative and not square of pooled-std
	bug on forecast windowsize (round on index/2)
	bug on zero values and initial values effects on histograms and plots (need large marker to identify and ignore)
	bug use of m vs m' on various performance metrics

	- bug lambda histogram is still (counting) through lambda growth and not its last value
	- bug lambda is wrong
	- bug histogram of lambda and perhaps others seem to loose data
	- bug minimum bug
        - bug histogram extra spikes

	plot of lambda with ats segments.
	plot of mseerrorcorr against mse form, negligible except for depart
	- code to control directory names to store approximation
	bug of how to create empty directory to write to it then

	optimize possibility through enhanced forecast logic 
	optimize possibility through mean vs. trimmed mean
	optimize possibility through mean vs. median
	optimize possibility through single vs multiple forecast
	optimize possibility through reducement forecast window
	optimize possibility through percentage rule with selection between (median, mean, trimmed mean)
	optimize possibility through performance stats based on m' and not m - check

	profiling setup
		- optimize possibility through slim, trimmed for profiling mode with reduced output, reduced state tracking mode - 
		- print-disabler
		- profiling setup

	verification of performance metrics routines
		verification of f-formula
		verification of ni formula
		verification of correlation-factor formula
		verify comparative plots on performance metrics such as corrl, variances, decision signal, and segment-based metrics for excel
		verify correctness with t=3.20 used in excel
		verify correctness of forecast, something seems wrong, delay, mean estimate, lack of use of trimmed estimates, etc.

	enhance trimmed forecast (with sorted drops, that doesn't work during changes as it drops the value that is desired).

	code to check whether gc exists in runtime 
		it is so apply gc otherwise remove it gc code

	verify mse errorcorr plot value time series and descripton
	- done - implement plot on mse-diff (bound-accu) xyplot to t-vals
	- done - combine plots of new-decision on segment tracking/fine tracking

	histograms - correct the default value in histograms (such as 0 in errors, causes spikes in the dataplot).
		potential hypnotic credibility sabotage setup regarding correcting this with histogramseriesstart=buildupdelay
		setup to create credibility through gnuplot inflicted bug on past version 
			(broken pipes, knowing of bug, and getting to believe that changes are to fix bugs, observed hypnotic disclosure)
		
	histogram - range of error on error fast
	histogram - xy labels and time series names (e.g., lambda vs. segment duration)
	
	html - move figure 5 after 6 (behavior after correspondance)

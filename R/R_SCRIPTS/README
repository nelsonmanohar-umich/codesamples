# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.



### MOST IMPORTANT DIRECTORIES ###
    1. Main directory is R_SCRIPTS.
    2. Main directory is EMSEMBLE for PYTHON CLASSIFIER ANALYTICS
    3. Main directory is LINEAR_REGRESSION for PYTHON REGRESSION ANALYTICS



### R_ANALYTICS (R_SCRIPTS DIRECTORY): ###
    R analytics contain machine learning and predictive analytics in R
    for various general areas. Of course, these have not yet been optimized
    and thus are limited by your environment R's runtime limitations.

#### 24 -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm 13787 Oct  4 22:54 dbscan.R    ####
    Implements a version of dbscan which instead uses transitive closure which 
    allows to do heuristics about the search space and adaptations to it.
    For example, it allows to discover the value of EPSILON that fits
    the data. Experimental as all in here as written in past 24 hrs.

#### 36 -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm 26314 Oct  4 19:58 clustering_methods.R ####
    Implements a diagnostics version of kmeans which provides feedback about
    the convergence of kmeans within iterations given a value of K.
    Experimental as all in here as written in past 24 hrs.

#### 16 -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  4610 Oct  3 02:56 recommender_igraphs.R ####
    Implements plotting of adjacency matrices produced by the recommender system 
    using igraph. Currently based on adjacency non-sparse matrix representation 
    which does NOT scale well with dataset size for this application as

#### 48K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  38K Sep 25 20:20 recommender_systems.R ####
#### 48K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  38K Sep 25 20:20 recommender_systems.R ####
    Implements an iterative convergence collaborative filtering and 
    recommendation system, tailored for the movielens dataset. 
    1. Collaborative filtering is done via iterative convergence between 
       Theta parameters and X-feature parameters. 
    2. Recomendations are done using euclidean (at this time) distances 
       wrt shortest-path neighbors at one and two degree of separations.

#### 56K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  46K Sep 24 18:23 stochastic_gradient_descent.R ####
    Performs gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, fminunc, and
    normal equations with or without regularization over numerical datasets.

#### 24K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  14K Sep 25 19:56 distances.R ####
    Implements by wraping distance computations after various 
    transformations: pca, probability, and scaling transforms for
    numerical and/or categorical datasets.

#### 36K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  26K Sep 23 21:03 anomaly_detection.R ####
    Implements anomaly detection over a numerical dataset wrt to
    1. Gaussian univariate (independent features) 
    2. Gaussian multivariate (otherwise)

#### 24K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  16K Sep 19 21:16 t_tests.R ####
    Implements simpler/selected t_tests statistical tests procedures with 
        1. iterative or not wrappers 
        2. over full or subsampled datasets.

#### 20K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm 9.7K Sep 26 13:25 basket_rules.R ####
    Performs heuristic optimization via grid search for Market Basket Analysis 
    to identify the highest confidence/support RHS for the specified LHS.

#### 36K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  26K Sep 25 17:53 datasets.R ####
    Generates and load datasets into expected format for the analytics.

    Wraps up some selected fSelect.R feature selection algorithms for
    numerical and categorical datasets on classification and/or regression 
    problems

#### 32K -rw-rw-r-- 1 nrm nrm  23K Sep 24 16:23 utilities.R ####
    Wraps ups various common utilities used by various of these modules.

### What is this repository for? ###

The goal is to provide access to some quickly developed code-samples I put over a few days so as to facilitate discussion.

* Quick summary *
    TO CASUAL VISITORS:
    1. Please do not branch YET from this codebase as the code is CURRENTLY way 
       too preliminary; it's is just a matter of a few days old (Sep/26/2014);
       i.e., version 0.00b. 

    2. However, you are welcome to BROWSE at this time the codebase.
       If you find it or a part useful and decide to recycle it, please 
       follow accordance to the provided GNU license along with an URL
       reference to the original [codebase] (https://bitbucket.org/nelsonmanohar/machinelearning)

* Version: *
    Again, just to be clear: version 0.001b.

PREPARATIONS:
1) install,packages( as.indicated by message(reshape, ggplot2, rpart, etc.))
2) place multiplot.R (must be in same directory)
3) note R will auto generate and then store png figures in the current directory, so you
must have write permissions for it. 
4) if you don't want to execute script, then you can view the high resolution images by
   doing: 
         tar -xvzf png_files.tar.gz; 
         mv ./PNG/*.png .
   this will also allow you to readily view the thumbtack.html file since it links 
   to those image names on the current directory.

RUN ANALYSIS:
1) Rscript ./thumbtack.R
2) running the file generates an html file that contains an auto-generated report
3) running the file generates about 10 png image files used to support the report

REVIEW ANALYSIS:
1) firefox ./thumbtack.html
